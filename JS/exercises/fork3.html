 * Lets do some math!
 * Some rules first:
 *   Enter the operations, replacing the `"?"`, make the computer do the work for you. 
 *   Do not manually enter the answer, for example: "one plus ten" would look like 1+10
 * 
 * a = one plus eight
 * b = 22 times three
 * c = the *remainder* of 5/4
 * d = the variable 'a' minus 17
 * e = the sum of the previous four variables

Correct answers: 
a)	9
b)	66
c)	1
d)	-8
e)	68
